## User Experience (UX)

#### Returning Visitor Goals

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The two main colours used are Dark Grey (#262626), and Burnt Yellow (#edcd1d) along with White (#fafafa/#fff) as an accent for the page.
I also use a Darker Yellow (#756409) to contrast with the Burnt Yellow (#edcd1d) for headers on different pages.

#### Typography

Oswald is actually a reworking of the classic style historically represented by the ‘Alternate Gothic’ sans serif typefaces. The characters of Oswald have been initially re-drawn and reformed to superior match the pixel grid of regular digital screens. Oswald is developed to be applied freely across the internet by net browsers on desktop computer systems, laptops and mobile devices.

#### Imagery

Imagery is important. The large hero image on the homepage is designed to match the colour theme of the page whilst adding intriguing visuals to entice users. It is contextual whilst also appealing to the eye.
The images within the store are designed to include the planned merchandise release from the organization, having a zoom effect to help add some interactiveness to the page

## Deployment

### GitPages (https://alexjakeman.github.io/TeamEndalex.github.io)- 

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.
    
### Liveserver (localhost:5500)
    1. Install Liveserver extension for Visual Studio Code.
    2. Select "Go Live" in the bottom right of VS Code.
    3. Observe browser window has opened with a local version of your website.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Notables (regarding assessment criterias)

### File structure within project

- I would have preferred to keep image files, page html files and stylesheets all separate in order to improve organization, however GitPages was unable to work without having them all at the main branch level. As per commits in the early stages of the project, I did have separate folders for different files within the project.

## Credits

- Stock images were found from Adobe Stock (as per "Technologies used" section).
