    Design
        Colour Scheme
            The two main colours used are Dark Grey (#262626), and Burnt Yellow (#edcd1d) along with White (#fafafa/#fff) as an accent for the page.
            I also use a Darker Yellow (#756409) to contrast with the Burnt Yellow (#edcd1d) for headers on different pages.
        Typography
            Oswald is actually a reworking of the classic style historically represented by the ‘Alternate Gothic’ sans serif typefaces. The characters of Oswald have been initially re-drawn and reformed to superior match the pixel grid of regular digital screens. Oswald is developed to be applied freely across the internet by net browsers on desktop computer systems, laptops and mobile devices.
        Imagery
            Imagery is important. The large hero image on the homepage is designed to match the colour theme of the page whilst adding intriguing visuals to entice users. It is contextual whilst also appealing to the eye.
            The images within the store are designed to include the planned merchandise release from the organization, having a zoom effect to help add some interactiveness to the page
