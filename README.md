### Media Queries

#### Navbar

    - When creating the navbar, a drop-down menu was a more enticing option from a mobile perspective, since this allowed users to see more of the page whilst having easy access to other pages. The desktop view has all pages within a click of a button, since there is more screen real estate to use.

- Mobile

- Desktop
![Image of a Modal from the Desktop user's perspective](/public/images/readme/navbar-desktop-view.png)

#### Modals

    - A lot of time was spent ensuring that the modal windows were compatible with devices made from all sizes. Part of this was to ensure that it would look normal in both landscape and portrait views for desktop and mobile users alike.

#### Homepage Layout

    - When designing the homepage, I decided to have a sidebar that would contain information about the team, as well as the CEO. A form for users to ask questions was also added as this is easily accessible. This wouldn't have been a viable option when using the website from a mobile POV, so instead these items are added as extra cards at the bottom of the page.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The two main colours used are Dark Grey (#262626), and Burnt Yellow (#edcd1d) along with White (#fafafa/#fff) as an accent for the page.
I also use a Darker Yellow (#756409) to contrast with the Burnt Yellow (#edcd1d) for headers on different pages.

#### Typography

Oswald is actually a reworking of the classic style historically represented by the ‘Alternate Gothic’ sans serif typefaces. The characters of Oswald have been initially re-drawn and reformed to superior match the pixel grid of regular digital screens. Oswald is developed to be applied freely across the internet by net browsers on desktop computer systems, laptops and mobile devices.

#### Imagery

Imagery is important. The large hero image on the homepage is designed to match the colour theme of the page whilst adding intriguing visuals to entice users. It is contextual whilst also appealing to the eye.
The images within the store are designed to include the planned merchandise release from the organization, having a zoom effect to help add some interactiveness to the page

### Wireframes

#### Figma (Mobile/Desktop)
